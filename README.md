# ClearMind

This is my mindmapping program! It's not that great yet, you can only add, remove, and move dots (aka nodes, but I like 'dots' better because Node is 
a reserved JS package). Anyway, I will soon allow for linking and possibly even physics - I did experiment with physics, but it was a bit wonky so I'll 
need to try again later.

- More to come!!
