It is hard to organize all of the things we have to do and things we want to remember. I propose a mind mapping app that focuses specifically on three things:
	1. quick-entry: entering data extremely quickly (using keyboard shortcuts, gestures, and intuitive UI)
	2. perspective-based display: displaying connections in multiple perspectives (including multiple parents)
	3. good performance: ensuring great performance even with large groups of data (using Pts.js)

// START
	The app will start with a blank screen.
// SELECTION
	user clicks dot
		dot has appearance change to selected
	user drags on blank canvas
		low-opacity square appears in the shape of the drag
		dots within the square are selected
// BUTTONS
	LINKBUTTON: probably 'enter' key
	SIBLINGBUTTON: probably 'tab' key
	PERSPECTIVESHIFTBUTTON: probably 'shift' key (lol, perspective 'shift')
// DOT CREATION
	> user clicks blank area of the screen
		text box opens
			> user types a name into the box
				> user clicks outside of the box OR user presses escape
					creation is cancelled
					no dot is created
					text box disappears
				> many dots, dots X, Y, Z for example, are already selected
					> user presses LINKBUTTON
						dot B becomes a child of all selected dots
					> user presses SIBLINGBUTTON
						logically... dot B becomes a sibling of all selected dots? not sure. what if they don't have parents? see {ABCDEFG.}
				> one dot, dot A, is already selected
					> user presses LINKBUTTON
						dot B is created
						text box clears
						dot B is made a child of (and becomes linked to) dot A
					> user presses SIBLINGBUTTON
						dot B is created
						text box clears
						> dot A has a parent
							dot B gets linked to the parent of dot A
							dot B is now a sibling of A
						> dot A has no parent
							? {ABCDEFG}
				> no dots are already selected
					> user presses LINKBUTTON
						dot B is created
						text box clears
					> user presses SIBLINGBUTTON
						? {view ABCDEFG}
// DOT FILTERING/PERSPECTIVES
	> user presses PERSPECTIVESHIFTBUTTON
		> perhaps this is just clicking on a separate parent to see the new relations?
		> example...?
			user has the following chart:
				alphabet
					made up of: letters
						
// should have category nodes and info nodes? Hmmm.
/// ok, so pts can't really handle 40k+ either lol. Let's think.
// 10k or so with canvas is fine.
